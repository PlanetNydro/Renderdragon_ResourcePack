# Renderdragon Resource Pack
Renderdragon is a minecraft resource pack based on a pun. Made it a while ago and only recently got around to sharing it anywhere.

All it does is change the Enderdragon into a neon-green wireframe, add an extra letter to its name, and make the pink bossbar green. Thats about it.

Currently works with version 1.21.3
